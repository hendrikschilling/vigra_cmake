hdf5:
- perl finding (gen headers only if ...?)
- gen headers in build dir

paths:
- replace all CMAKE_BUILd_DIR instance with the respective path (differes depending on location!)

various
- alle VAD files should be an explicit dependency in cmake (for auto-rebuild!)

variables:
- its not enough to generate a target somw variables need to be set (globally in CACHE) for _other_ dependencies (e.g. eigen -> ceres)

IDEA:
- hijack (or replace with something else) add_library to provide auto-build/checkout of targets!

- PROBLEMS: global variable force a lot of rebuilding...


CMAKE/libs:
- gen header dirs on config run (not as target!)
