hdf5:
- perl finding (gen headers only if ...?)
- gen headers in build dir

paths:
- replace all CMAKE_BUILd_DIR instance with the respective path (differes depending on location!)

various
- alle VAD files should be an explicit dependency in cmake (for auto-rebuild!)

variables:
- its not enough to generate a target somw variables need to be set (globally in CACHE) for _other_ dependencies (e.g. eigen -> ceres)

IDEA:
- hijack (or replace with something else) add_library to provide auto-build/checkout of targets!

- PROBLEMS: global variable force a lot of rebuilding...


CMAKE/libs:
- gen header dirs on config run (not as target!)
- fix vad_make_imported_target_global to not use alias? (fixes add_dependencies problems, see VAD_Ceres)
- don't use CMAKE_MODULE_PATH for VAD_*** (is sometimes overwritten, for example _within_ CeresConfig!)

- CHECK: some find_packages (like HDF5) call themselves again (with different options!)
- check alternatives! (e.g. Eigen or Eigen3?)


Eigen:
- should not add eigen path to camek package repo because a later search will find build_external_dep/eigenconfig!
