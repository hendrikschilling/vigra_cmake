Introduction
================

Welcome to the documentation for the **ucalib** calibration library.
This library implements a model-less ray based calibration method, specifically for high accuracy non-central camera calibration. Special features include support for imperfect (deformed) calibration targets, multi-camera setups and recitification.

Look at the [installation](@ref doc/install.md) instructions, the [Tutorial](@ref doc/calib_howto.md) for an example calibration using the supplied samples or at a [walkthrough](@ref doc/procedure.md) of the api.

For more in-depth details, the calibration method is described in [calibration](@ref doc/overview.md) and details regarding the use of the library is documented in [API](@ref doc/api.md).
